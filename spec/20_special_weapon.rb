# 20 - Special Weapon (Bonus)

# Introduce concept of a special weapon
# which is like a grenade but with a range of 1.
# However, instead of being targetted at a specific robot,
#  this weapon is a one-time use weapon
#  that damages all robots surrounding it.
# Its damage goes straight through the shields
# (if you implemented shields)
# and directly affects their health by 30 points.
